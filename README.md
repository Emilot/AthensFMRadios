**Athens (Greece) FM Radios pls files**

These pls files were heavily based on the following m3u file:

https://gist.github.com/dennmtr/ac14e66adca47e5f7d60


Note: If you don't find a specific radio this means:

1. I forgot it
2. I did not find a usable http stream (ex. SKAI 100.3)
3. It's a religious radio station

For 1 and 2 feel free to open issues, fork and send back etc..
