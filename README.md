**Athens (Greece) FM Radios pls files**

These pls files were heavily based on the following m3u file:

https://gist.github.com/dennmtr/ac14e66adca47e5f7d60


Note: If you didn't find a specific radio this means:

1. I forgot it
2. I did not find a usable http stream (ex. SKAI 100.3)
3. It's a religious radio station

For 1 and 2 feel and in cases where an existing pls is not functional, free to open issues, fork and send back etc.. 

For 3, please go away immediately or I will use my dark unholy skills to destroy you.. Seriously!


In order to use these radios with Archphile, you will need to use the included script (arf.sh):

	wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/archphile/AthensFMRadios/master/archphile-script/arf.sh
	chmod +x arf.sh
	./arf.sh

PS. These files were created for "real" people that want to listen to the radio and not for "audiophiles" (who gives a fuck about them anyway?)!
